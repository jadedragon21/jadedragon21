# âš¡ Technologies

## Now I am not claiming to be stupendously proficient in the below tech. However, I am still in the middle of studying and learning the basics.
## With alot more practice and training who knows where I'll be in the future?? Maybe building some otome game for an app on Android devices.

# About Me Section: Personal not Pro

Things I Enjoy: | 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
Reading Manga & Web Novels | 
Older console RPG, Puzzle, Strategy Games | 
Fluffy/Velvety/Soft/Cute Things | 

### Some games that I enjoy playing are older console/pc games like Legend of Mana, Suikoden 3, Saga Frontier 2, Wild Arms series, Early Ps1-Ps3 console Tales series, Diablo/Starcraft/Warcraft, King's Quest series, Total Annihilation, Mech Warrior.

### Handhelds Im playing or want to play at the moment:

### Story of Seasons, Animal Crossing, Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and I'm looking forward to playing Rune Factory 5 & the new Story of Seasons:POOT and the Harvest Moon: One World....

### SOS and HM both have their weak points and strengths. SOS has better game mechanics and overall play styles and well the character sprites in Harvest Moon look better in my opinion. 

### I will say Rune Factory has the best of both worlds in art, music, & game mechanics. I enjoyed playing the whole series.

### I really enjoying playing otome games as well as pc games such as Ark Survival Evolved, Wurm Unlimited, Wurm Online, Eve Online, 7 Days to Die, etc. <---These are just the ones I spend the most time playing, when I have free time.
 

## *Placeholder for resume Link* -->Currently in the process of rewriting one for a career change.

## *Placeholder for professional About me Section* Getting pointers.

# _**Goals for the near Future**_

### I want to graduate this class with great grades and gain more confidence in myself to interact with people again. I'm a pretty laid back chill person. I try to get things done in a timely manner and am very organized when it is crunch time or at work. I'm a bit OCD and I get anxious around people at first but once I know who you are I can get along great with "most" people. I've worked in retail alot and have gained many different perspectives, new skills, team building skills and Im very excited to learn coding! I've grown up around tech most of my life. My dad is a computer engineer he can do most things through hands on experience and after I finish this course I plan on "apprenticing" to him so that I can gain some of his knowledge. I am getting into a new mind set for the future. Logic isn't my strong suit and I'm slow at math sometimes. I know my strengths are in the creative/idea/reverse engineering depts.  Tech and programming are going to be around a long time and I plan to jump on this chance before it slips out of my grasp.
